		<h2>What is a jellyfish?</h2>
		
		<p>Jellyfishes are marine animals with soft&#44; gelatinous bodies without bones. They have tentacles&#44; or antennae&#44; which they use to sting their prey. 
		Jellyfishes are related to corals and sea anemones’.</p>

		<h2>Physical description</h2>
		
		<p class="margin">The physical size of a jellyfish depends on its species. There are jellyfishes as small as the genera Elutheria and Staurocladia which are 
		in the shape of a bell disc of 0.5 mm. On the other hand some jellyfish are humongous&#44; and have tentacles up to lengths of 36.5 m&#44; like the 
		Lion&rsquo;s mane jellyfish. Like the size of a jellyfish&#44; their weight varies a lot&#44; too. An adult box jellyfish can weigh up to 2 kg (4.4 lb) 
		while the giant Nomura’s jellyfish weighs about 200 kg. The jellyfish is a magnificent creature&#44; and one of my favourite aspects is its many
		colours. Some are clear&#44; while others are purple&#44; blue&#44; yellow&#44; and pink. There are even bioluminescent jellyfish! The bell of a jellyfish 
		is the umbrella-like shape which is hollow and contains mesoglea&#44; which acts like an hydrostatic skeleton. The mesoglea comprises water&#44; 
		collagen&#44; fibrous proteins&#44; and mobile amebocytes that can engulf bacteria and debris; it is a mass of jelly-like tissue. Under the bell of 
		jellyfish is a structure similar to a tube&#44; called the manubrium. It hangs down from the middle&#44; along with the mouth&#44; which opens into a 
		gastrovascular cavity used for digestion and absorption of nutrients. Finally&#44; jellyfish do not have a brain&#44; heart&#44; bones or eyes. However&#44; 
		they do have  light-sensitive organs called ocelli or simple eyes. Others&#44; such as the box jellyfish&#44; have an advanced vision with each 
		individual possessing 24 eyes.</p>

		<h2>Habitat</h2>
		
		<p class="margin">Jellyfish are capable of living in all types of water bodies. Jellyfish such as the golden jellyfish can life in freshwater. On the other 
		hand&#44; the lion&rsquo;s mane jellyfish can survive in Arctic water. There are even jellyfishes capable of living in water near the tropics. Many 
		jellyfish float near the surface of oceans. Some lay at the bottom of lagoons&#44; and stalked-jellyfish are attached to seaweed and rocks and 
		can&rsquo;t leave the ocean floor.</p>

		<h2>Life expectancy</h2>
		
		<p class="margin">Scientists aren&rsquo;t sure about the lifespan of many jellyfish&#44; such as the ones that are near the ocean floor. However&#44; they do know jellyfish 
		living in coastal waters have an average lifespan of 12-18 months. When in captivity and taken care of right&#44; the moon jellyfish can life for 20 
		years. Or&#44; the flame jellyfish&#44; which lives in warm waters&#44; live for 3-12 months. Fun fact&#44; once jellyfish die&#44; sea turtles love munching on them!</p>
		
		<h3>Life cycle</h3>
		
		<p class="margin">Throughout their life&#44; they can take on two different forms; medusa or polyps. Medusas reproduce sexually (release eggs and sperm.) On the other 
		hand&#44; polyps reproduce asexually (budding.)</p>

		<h2>Diet</h2>
		
		<p class="margin">They are parasitic or predatory animals. Their diet consists of planktonic organisms&#44; such as algae&#44; bacteria&#44; protozoa&#44; and archaea. 
		However&#44; it does not end there they even consume crustaceans&#44; fish eggs&#44; larvae&#44; small fish&#44; and other jellyfish. Some species&#44; like the 
		Aglaura hemistoma&#44; are omnivores that feed on a mixture of microscopic plants and free-floating protozoa and crustaceans. The mouth of a jellyfish 
		is found from this small opening it both eats and discards waste. From this small opening it both eats and discards waste. </p>
		
		<h2>Behaviour</h2>
		
		<p class="margin">Once jellyfish are "adults"&#44; they spawn (release sperm and eggs) regularly if there is a sufficient food supply. Many jellyfish of the same species 
		spawn around the same time&#44; usually dawn or dusk. While these sea creatures swim they conserve a lot of their energy&#44; by swimming  through radial 
		expansion and contraction of their bell-shaped bodies&#44; this is called&#44; passive energy recapture. It gives them the ability to swim 30% farther on each 
		cycle. Furthermore&#44; jellyfish form blooms or large masses under their optimal range. Jellyfish are even able to detect ocean currents&#44; and swim against 
		them. Finally&#44; they remain inactive at night&#44; usually pulsing about 39 times per minute while their normal pulse is 58 times per minute during the day.</p>

		<h2>Adaptations</h2>
		
		<p class="margin">Jellyfishes have many adaptations;  here is a list of just a few...</p>
		
		<ol class="margin">
			<li>Jellyfish have nematocysts (stinging cells.)
				<ul>
					<li>They will sting predators&#44; to protect themselves against a threat. Making contact with their tentacles prompts thousands of nematocysts 
					to inject venom into the body of a predator.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Jellyfish have incredibly long tentacles.
				<ul>
					<li>Used to capture prey and push food into their mouths.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>They have bell-shaped bodies.
				<ul>
					<li>Have special muscles which contract&#44; allowing them to propel forward. And once the contraction is over&#44; their bodies recoil elastically 
					allowing them to stop.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The jellyfish&rsquo;s thin epidermis permits the diffusion of oxygen.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Reproduction/Mating</h2>
		
		<p>Matured jellyfish release sperm or eggs&#44; and in the surrounding area eggs which have fertilized grow into larvae. In a few species&#44; the sperm enters the 
		mouth of female jellyfishes and go through the process of fertilization within their body. The eggs which fertilize mature to planula larvae. Which in turn become 
		polyps that pass through the immature ephyra stage and finally ro transform into matured medusas.</p>
