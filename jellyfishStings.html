		<h1>Why should you NOT pee on a jellyfish sting?</h1>
		
		<p>There are many reasons that you shouldn&rsquo;t pee on a jellyfish sting, there is no scientific evidence to support this myth, and there are steps you 
		can take to safely remove a jellyfish sting. First, scientists believe that if you pee on a jellyfish sting, it can increase the pain. The tentacles of a 
		jellyfish have stinger cells, nematocysts, which contain the venom. If you urinate on the sting, the cells can release more venom as urine contains a lot 
		of water. Additionally, there are three steps you can take to remove a jellyfish sting. First, remove the tentacles using seawater. Then use tweezers to 
		remove the barbs. Finally, apply apple cider vinegar or isopropyl alcohol to ease the pain. To conclude, there are many reasons you shouldn&rsquo;t pee on a jellyfish sting, 
		as there is no scientific evidence to back this myth up, and there are steps you can take to safely remove a jellyfish sting.</p>
		
		<h1>What is the science behind a jellyfish sting?</h1>
		
		<p>The tentacles of a jellyfish have stinger cells, nematocysts. These cells contain venom. When you touch a jellyfish, its stingers are 
		activated and release venom. However, if you were to urinate on a jellyfish sting, it can cause the cells (nematocysts) to release even more venom.</p>
		
		<h1>What SHOULD you do when you&rsquo;re stung by a jellyfish?</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>Remove any tentacles on your skin using seawater.</li>
				<li>Using tweezers remove any barbs.</li>
				<li>Apply apple cider vinegar or isopropyl alcohol to relive any pain.</li>
			</ol>
		<h1>Why is this myth so popular?</h1>
		
		<p>First off, this myth has been seen on many popular TV shows, such as Friends. Furthermore, there are compounds found in urine such as, ammonia and 
		urea, which can improve other bites. However, urine has a lot of water, which in turn dilutes these compounds.</p>
